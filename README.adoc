Asciidoctor PlantUml is an extension that enables you to add
{uri-plantuml}[PlantUML] diagrams to your AsciiDoc documents.

This extension differs from others like {uri-asciidoctor-diagram}[Asciidoctor
Diagram] and {uri-py-plantuml}[AsciiDoc PlantUML filter] in that this extension
does not include PlantUML jar files. Instead it depends on the availability of
an external PlantUML server.

== Installation

Asciidoctor PlantUml is a RubyGem and can be installed via `gem` or `bundle`
commands:

    $ gem install asciidoctor-plantuml

== Creating a diagram

A diagram is written inside an open block inside any asciidoc file:

....
[plantuml, format="png", id="myId"]
----
alice -> bob : hello
bob -> alice : hello
----
....

NOTE: You can omit the @startuml/@enduml delimiters. The extension adds them if missing.

TIP: You can create any diagram type supported by PlantUML: sequence, usecase, class, activity, etc.

WARNING: You must use an open block, that is delimited by two *-* instead of four as in a literal block.

The above example is substituted by the following HTML snippet when processed by
this extension:

[source, html]
----
<img id="myId" class="plantuml" src="http://localhost:8080/png/S3dx3fjsaso3d" />
----

=== PlantUML Server

By default the image source follows the following URL pattern:

.PlantUML URL Pattern
----
<server base uri>/<format>/<encoded diagram>
----

The *<server base uri>* by defaults is *http://localhost:8080/plantuml* and can
be changed using the following code:

[source,ruby]
----
require "asciidoctor-plantuml"

Asciidoctor::PlantUml.configure do |conf|
  conf.url = "http://my-private-server:8080"
end
----

In 2020 the plantuml.com server changed the URL encoding.
Now you'll need to add a small string to signal the encoding.
You can enable the new behavior like this:

[source,ruby]
----
require "asciidoctor-plantuml"

Asciidoctor::PlantUml.configure do |conf|
  conf.url = "https://www.plantuml.com"
  conf.encoding = 'deflate'
end
----

The *<format>* is taken from the block format attribute. It defaults to *png*
and can take any of *png*, *txt* and *svg*.

The *<encoded diagram>* is generated automatically by this extension.
This is the diagram string compressed and encoded in a format that the PlantUML
server understands.

=== Diagram Attributes

There are some attributes you can add to the block to customize how the diagram
is displayed:

  - id: Sets the id attribute of the img element.
  - alt: Sets the alt attribute of the img element.
  - width: Sets the width attribute of the img element.
  - height: Sets the height attribute of the img element.
  - format: Sets the format of the generated image. Can be either png, svg or
    txt.

== Using Asciidoctor Cli

To load the asciidoctor-plantuml extension when using the asciidoctor command
line tool you can use the `-r` flag:

    asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-plantuml sample.adoc

If you want to change the default PlantUML server you can use *PLANTUML_URL*
environment variables:

    PLANTUML_URL="https://my-private-server:80/" asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-plantuml sample.adoc


== Installing PlantUML Server

=== Docker

The simplest way to start a PlantUML server is using docker:

    docker run -d --name plantuml -p 8081:8080 plantuml/plantuml-server:jetty

=== Source

In Ubuntu first you need to create a plantuml.war file from the source code:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install tomcat7 graphviz openjdk-7-jdk git-core maven
git clone https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-server.git
cd plantuml-server
mvn package
----

Then copy the *plantuml.war* file generated when building the package (mvn package) to the Tomcat applications folder:


[source,bash]
----
sudo cp plantuml.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/plantuml.war
sudo chown tomcat7:tomcat7 /usr/share/jetty/webapps/plantuml.war
sudo service restart tomcat7
----

After restarting Tomcat the application will be running on the server port 8080.
You can change the port and other parameters in the */etc/tomcat7/server.xml* file.

You may also need to set the JAVA_HOME variable in the */etc/defaults/tomcat7*
file if you have the java runtime in a non-standard place.
